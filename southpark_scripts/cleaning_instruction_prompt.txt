Here is a summary of the most important formatting rules for the script:

1. Character Dialogues:
   - Begin with the character's name followed by a comma (e.g., "Cartman,").
   - Enclose dialogue in quotation marks (e.g., "Wow, coo'..." [snaps a picture] "Chocolate rules!").
   - Include character actions in square brackets within the dialogue (e.g., "snaps a picture").

2. Interjections and Reactions:
   - Use square brackets for brief actions or reactions within the dialogue (e.g., "[The students all move to the next spot in the tour]").

3. Scene descriptions, Transitions and Group Actions:
   - Begin the line with a comma followed by a brief description of the setting and actions in plain text without quotation marks (e.g., ",At South Park Elementary, Mr. Garrison's class.").
   - Indicate scene transitions with a comma and a brief description (e.g., ",At South Park Elementary, Mr. Garrison's class.").
   - Describe group actions in plain text without character names (e.g., "the celebrities nod and agree").

5. Special Characters:
   - Use character names followed by dialogue in quotation marks for internal or special dialogues (e.g., "Narrator,").

6. Non-English Language:
   - Replace non-English dialogue with the English translation instead.

These rules ensure clarity and distinguish between actions, dialogue, and scene descriptions.
